# Exploring the Impact of Lifestyle and Health Factors on Diabetes Risk

This project investigates how modifiable lifestyle and health factorsâ€”such as **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, **physical activity**, and **blood pressure** contribute to the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Using the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)** dataset and a combination of **statistical analysis** and **machine learning models**, we aim to uncover insights and build predictive models for early diabetes risk detection.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [CDC BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)
- **Format**: CSV
- **Attributes**: Diabetes status, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, diet, general health, demographics, etc.

## Methods Used

- **Statistical Analysis**:  
  - Chi-Square Test (association between categorical variables)  
  - T-Test (comparison of BMI between diabetic and non-diabetic groups)

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  - Resampling techniques (e.g., ROSE) for class imbalance

- **Programming Language**: R

## Objectives

- Identify significant predictors of diabetes.
- Evaluate the association between lifestyle choices and diabetes prevalence.
- Build and evaluate predictive models for diabetes risk classification.

## Key Findings

- Higher **BMI**, **lack of physical activity**, and **high blood pressure** are strongly associated with diabetes.
- **XGBoost** outperformed other models in predictive accuracy and feature importance.
- Resampling improved model balance for minority classes (diabetic individuals).
